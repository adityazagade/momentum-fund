## Introduction

1. This repository is an implementation of the ideas mentioned in the book 'stocks on the move'. The book is written by
   Andreas Clenow.
2. The book is about momentum investing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3.
    1. We leverage Zerodha to pull OHLCV data. You need to have a Zerodha account. Log into your Zerodha account
       at https://kite.zerodha.com/ and copy the `enctoken` from the cookies to app.properties file.
    2. I was initially relying on `kite.trade` to fetch the date, but I don't want to spend 4k every month for it when I
       can get it for free.
    3.
5. Run the code by executing the main.py file (`python main.py`)
6. Enjoy!

## Usage

The code is written in python. The code is written in a modular way. The code is divided into 3 parts:
Details about the properties mentioned in app.properties file:

1. app.host=`localhost` (This is the host on which the code will run)
2. app.port=`7999` (This is the port on which the code will run)
3. app.debug=`True` (This is the debug flag. If set to True, the code will run in debug mode)
4. kite.ui.base_url=`https://kite.zerodha.com` (This is the base url of the kite website)
5. kite.ui.client_id=`KWxxxx` (This is the client id of your zerodha account)
6. kite.ui.enctoken=`xxxxxxx` (This is the enctoken of your zerodha account)
7. portfolio.file=`portfolio.csv` (This is the file where the initial portfolio will be stored)
8. trade_day=`SUNDAY` (This is the day on which all the trades will be executed)
9. stock_universe_index=`NIFTY 50` (Stocks from this index will be considered for the portfolio)
10. num_historical_lookup_days=`365` (Number of days to look back for historical data)

Files generated by the code:

1. ranking.csv - This file contains the ranking of all the stocks in the stock universe. The stocks are ranked based on
   their volatility adjusted momentum.
2. portfolio.csv - This file contains the initial portfolio.
3. portfolio_self_momentum_**.csv - These files are created when the code is run. These files contain the portfolio
   after each rebalancing.
